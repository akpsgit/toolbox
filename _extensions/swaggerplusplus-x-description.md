  Add a OpenAPI 3.x `description` to elements such as path items in an OpenAPI 2.0 API description document
  where `description` is not allowed.
  This allows converting OpenAPI 2.0 to OpenAPI 3.0 for tools which work with OpenAPI 3.0.
example:
  paths:
    "/books":
      x-description: This resource is a collection of books.
