slug: oai-membership-engagement
description: This is a project to engage with OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) membership and increase their representation and participation within the OAI and the OpenAPI community. We are working on a variety of ways in which we can get OAI members involved with not just OpenAPI, but other specifications, make it a perfect API Specification Toolbox project. This was one of the first things identified as being deficient in the community in the early days of the the API Specification Toolbox meetings.
