description: <p>Design, deploy, and monitor your cloud-native applications, easily.
  Applications running on serverless architectures scale up and down on demand with
  high availability. There is no need to provision or manage servers. Your code runs
  only when it's needed, and you only pay for the compute time you use. Stackery provides
  operational tools for developers building serverless applications.
