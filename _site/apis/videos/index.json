   "description": "OpenAPI definitions are traditionally used to expose the API functionality to customers. But a wave of tools have emerged in the past year that allow to test and secure APIs automatically from OpenAPI definitions. In this talk, we explain why the OpenAPI specs are suited for security and present a set of tools you can leverage today to make your APIs more robust to attacks, and this starting at design time.",

   "name": "Going AsyncAPI - The Good, The Bad, and The Awesome",
   "description": "In this talk, I’ll explore the good, bad, and awesome aspects of building Async API into our open data hub. As advocates of open source tools, it is our mission to simplify the collection and distribution of streaming data by taking care of everything under the hood, including business-to-business exchange of data and “last mile” delivery to end consumers. Beginning with a discussion on open API, I’ll walk you through our deliberations, and why we chose AsyncAPI, how it helped us and what it cost. I’ll tell you how we improved our tools to make use of AsyncAPI specs; how we managed the gaps in the specification; along with the benefits. AsyncAPI spun out of open API with a goal to solve some of its shortcomings. The initiative set out to standardize asynchronous and event driven APIs across the industry. With the proliferation of IoT devices and the connectivity promised by 5G, having standard ways to connect has become more important than ever. AsyncAPI has been added to every product we host on our open platform. Why? Because we believe AsyncAPI is a good standard for open event based data/APIs, and we want to support a proper way to carry out code generation and validation - with specifications that make sense. Thousands of software engineers around the world have provided code, documentation, tests, or other improvements to open source projects. With the help of initiatives like AsyncAPI we want to help people liberate their data by tackling the common challenges they face when trying to distribute it.",

   "name": "GraphQL, gRPC and REST, Oh My! A Method for Unified API Design",
   "description": "As APIs are adopted in more and more organizations, the need for successful API design and implementation becomes more pressing. Companies that adopt a single API definition format (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Schema Definition Language, Protobuff, etc.) are likely to find their options limited as their API ecosystem grows and matures over time. In order to avoid forcing the entire company to adopt a single API style or format, no matter the requirements of providers and consumers, we need a unified API design process. One that doesn't pre-determine implementation details such as REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and others. Based on materials in Amundsen's book "Design and Build Great Web APIs", this talk describes a simple, repeatable process for API designers to capture and document design details in a way that allows API developers to make their own decisions on which API style best fits the needs of the company and the consumer. Whether you are responsible for API architecture, design, implementation, or support, this talk provides valuable information on how you can improve the quality of your APIs from start to finish.",

   "name": "How Postman Uses Postman to Build APIs",
   "description": "Postman has grown from a side project into a billion-dollar startup. One way their engineers have stayed ahead of their 11 million users, is by dogfooding their own tech. Learn how the engineering team uses Postman collections to build their own private APIs. While the Postman collection is not a specification description format, the Postman engineering team uses them like one. At Postman, collections are used to design, develop, and validate their APIs within a microservice architecture. Hear about the challenges the Postman engineering team faces using Postman throughout the API development lifecycle.",

   "name": "Not your Uncle's Auth - OAuth2.1 and Other Updates in Securing Your API",
   "description": "OAuth 2.0 and adjacent technologies, such as the JWT format, have been been extraordinarily successful in providing a viable mechanism for authorizing API calls in a wide variety of scenarios. The lax nature of the specification, however, left a lot as exercise for the reader- which resulted in many insecure and non interoperable deployments. The standard group worked to fill the gaps by releasing a sequence of addendum to the core spec, fleshing out new scenarios (native clients, SPAs), security recommendations and more, making it very hard for implementers to keep up with what's really needed to develop secure solutions. OAuth 2.1 is a proposed update to the core spec that incorporates back the most salient new guidance; together with new important updates, such as a profile detailing how to use JWT tokens in OAuth in interoperable fashion, it represents a new breed of guidance that will streamline your API security strategy. Come to this session to learn about those changes and how you can take advantage of them in your solution!",

{
   "name": "Open APIs Wide Open",
   "description": "The OpenAPI specification is open — really open. From the beginning, the specification allowed specification extensions (properties prefixed by "x-" ) just about anywhere. This feature adds extensibility, yes, but also great power. At Apiture, we embrace the API First design process and use specification extensions to augment our APIs, automate much of our build pipeline, and improve our developer experience. Extensions allow us to capture semantic information about the APIs in a structured way that tools can analyze and process. From our raw OpenAPI source files (with extensions), we generate secondary and even tertiary OpenAPI source files, which we then feed into code generators (openapi-generator and others) and API documentation generators. You’ll see how our OpenAPI annotations tool processes an input OpenAPI definition to generate an output OpenAPI definition with augmented and uniform descriptions strings for schema versioning, deprecation warnings, enhanced enumeration documentation, one-way data encryption, schema resolution and cleansing, and more. You too can use extensions to create better API definitions!",
