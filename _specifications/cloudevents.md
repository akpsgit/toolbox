name: CloudEvents
description: <p>Enter CloudEvents, a specification for describing event data in a
  common way. CloudEvents seeks to ease event declaration and delivery across services,
  platforms and beyond! CloudEvents is a new effort and it&rsquo;s still under active
  development. However, its working group has received a surprising amount of industry
  interest, ranging from major cloud providers to popular SaaS companies. Our end
  goal is to offer this specification to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.</p>
