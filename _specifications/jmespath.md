description: The JMESPath language is described in an ABNF grammar with a complete specification. This ensures that the language syntax is precisely defined. JMESPath has a full suite of data driven testcases. This ensures parity for multiple libraries, and makes it easy for developers to implement JMESPath in their language of choice.
