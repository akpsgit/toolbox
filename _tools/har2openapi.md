description: This program automatically creates API documentation via a OpenApi Spec (OAS) file by using network requests captured in one or more HAR files. Another way to generate HAR files is to install Charles Proxy and then run all your end-to-end browser tests. Charles Proxy saves its raw captures in a .chls file but you can export that to a har file as Charles Proxy outputs har files in a convenient json format. Generating HAR files using your end-to-end tests can save you a lot of manual clicking!
