description: Karate is the only open-source tool to combine API test-automation, mocks, performance-testing and even UI automation into a single, unified framework. The BDD syntax popularized by Cucumber is language-neutral, and easy for even non-programmers. Powerful JSON & XML assertions are built-in, and you can run tests in parallel for speed.
