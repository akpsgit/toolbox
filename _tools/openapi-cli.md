description: OpenAPI CLI toolbox with rich validation and bundling features. With openapi-cli, you can quickly validate a multi-file OpenAPI definition. An unbundled definition is far easier to edit and to reduce duplicated type definitions. When the definition is ready, openapi-cli makes it easy to bundle it into one file for distribution.
